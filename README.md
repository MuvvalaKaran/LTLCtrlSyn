# LTLCtrlSyn

Synthesis of a controller for system with linear dynamics using restricted LTL formula. This code is still a Work under progress. 

## Instructions to run

Run the LTL_ctrl.py program. The read_data file does not currently support reading user input and so please select 'y' when prompted to read data from file to load pre-entered data.

Future iteration will have more added feafture.

Feel free to give me any feedback or create issue that you face while running this software. Thank you
